I thought things were working, but apparently I was wrong. Trying to implement buttons that do things w/ the .kv file, not quite sure how. Feel like it shouldn't be as complicated as everything I am reading is making it out to be. I want the add items button the on add items page to write some data to a DB. Nothing is really working at the moment but I'm going to bed now.

Continued working w/ screen manager. Have buttons now. Next step is working on the add item page. Committing before breaking anything.

Started working w/ kivy screen manager. Now it's time to figure out how to build a UI. Committing before I break anything as this works now as is.
