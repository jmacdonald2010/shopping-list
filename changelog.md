for commits to the in-progress branch

Added the rest of the entry fields for the add item page. The formatting is not good, but I will change that once I get it writing to the database. Likely the last commit of the day.

I figured out how to do the dropdown menu I want to! I have it working now. I'm not a big fan of the current layout so I'm likely to switch to either a grid layout or a float layout.

No progress today. Trying to build a dropdown menu that has values from a database (list of units). Having absolutely no luck with this and unable to find anything useful online. Can't really make the input for w/ a normalized db w/o a dropdown list.

Typing in an item name now creates a new item object, and then after that, you can assign other values to that object (eg, quantity). Next step is creating the dropdown lists for units and stores. Units could be a hard-coded list, but stores can't be per my design, so this will be a challenge.

Added a working text field. Well, it makes text appear in the console, so that's a start.

Got the kivy button to do something w/ multiple screens! Pushing before I break it as I start to add more features.

I thought things were working, but apparently I was wrong. Trying to implement buttons that do things w/ the .kv file, not quite sure how. Feel like it shouldn't be as complicated as everything I am reading is making it out to be. I want the add items button the on add items page to write some data to a DB. Nothing is really working at the moment but I'm going to bed now.

Continued working w/ screen manager. Have buttons now. Next step is working on the add item page. Committing before breaking anything.

Started working w/ kivy screen manager. Now it's time to figure out how to build a UI. Committing before I break anything as this works now as is.

last commit of the night. Working on building a multiscreen app using kivy. About to largely demolish the current MainApp class to accomdate the new multiscreen code, wanted to commit so it's not gone forever. Going to bed soon.
